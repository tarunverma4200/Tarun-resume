        Tarun Verma – Photographer & Business Student<br>
        <br>
        Hi, I’m Tarun Verma,  international student at Langara College, currently pursuing a degree in Business Management with Photography as an elective course.<br>
        
        Photography has been my passion since childhood, inspired by my father, a professional photographer. Growing up, I was always fascinated by his work, accompanying him on shoots and assisting whenever I could. Over the years, this passion turned into my profession, and today, I continue to refine my skills while also expanding my knowledge in business.
